My codebase for C programming.

Made for my own needs in mind and to explore different ideas I use on a daily basis.

This codebase is focused on performance and reliability, not to be shareable

What's in the codebase?

- Base layer
  - Basic Memory Allocators
  - Collections of data structures I use
